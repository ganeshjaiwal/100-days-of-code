### Day 17: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued on the #Flutter app. 
Learning about state management using providers and consumers.
Flutter provides a lot of optimized options to rerender the app.
Using providers or consumers is totally depends on the structure of code and its use-case.
UI can be rendered using stateful widgets.
The best use case for using stateful widget is if changing data is only limited to the current widget.
